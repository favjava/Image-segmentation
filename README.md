# small-img-segmentation
This is a short and precise image segmentation project
The main motive of the "small-img-segmentation" is to provide various segmented images for better detection of required objects.

# Installations
# necessary modules to be imported:
  import skimage
  import scipy
  import numpy 
  import imutils
  import cv2

# Command to install modules.

You can simply install these modules with command "pip install 'module name' ".

For cv2 command is:       pip install opencv-python 
For skimage command is:   pip install scikit-image 
For numpy command is:     pip install numpy 
For imutils command is:   pip install imutils 
For scipy command is:     pip install scipy

# Execution of project: 
# You can choose your own images from PC and add the path in the imread function to generate the desired output.

1. Place all the files in the single project folder. 
2. Import all the files and modules.
3. Final.py is the main driver file from which all functions of segmentations are to be executed.
4. This is a menu driven program, so choose your required Segmentation options.
